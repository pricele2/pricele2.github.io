  + State-appointed Board, Superintendent, Chief Academic Officer, Chief Finance Officer
  + Functionally a hostile takeover
* Stakeholder turnover & attrition since attrition:
  + Teacher turnover > 30% annually
  + Estimate at least 75% turnover by [principals](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/education/hisd/article/state-takeover-hisd-numbers-enrollment-principals-20199238.php)
